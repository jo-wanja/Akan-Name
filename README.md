## Technologies Used
CSS & HTML & JAVASCRIPT
## BDD
I broke the task down into 3 tasks:
  1. Getting appropriate user input
  2. Using the input to determine the name
  3. Presenting the name to the user
### getting appropriate input
this will involve the use of forms and evaluating the inputs using conditional statements.
### Using Input
this wil require coming up with functions that takes the date as an argument/variable and returns the appropriate name
### Presenting the name
this will involve using the DOM model to link with the page and using it to present the result
